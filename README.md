# Cruise Ships üõ≥Ô∏è
Cruise Ships OOP/TDD exercise as part of CommandShift Bootcamp Syllabus

The project had the aim of taking some requirements, and translating them into object-oriented code. 

This involved developing the requirements into a domain model, which could then be used to form classes for objects which could interact with eachother.

## Classes
### Port üåä

The port object is instantiated with a name and an empty array of ships

<strong>Methods:</strong>

An addShip() method to add a ship object to the array of ships (called when a ship docks at a particular port)

A removeShip() method to remove a ship object from the array of ships (called when a ship sets sail from a particular port)

### Itinerary üìú

On instantiation, this object is passed an array of Port objects which make up the itinerary

### Ship üõ≥Ô∏è
The ship object is instantiated with an itinerary, a current port (the port in the itinerary which exists at index 0), a previous port (set to null), and the current port has the instantiated ship instance added to it.

Methods: 

A setSail() method which sets previous port property equal to the current port, and then sets the current port property equal to null

A dock() method which sets the current port property equal to the next port in the itinerary, and adds the ship to that port

## Testing

This project was developed using a test-driven development approach, and Jest was used as the testing framework, with each class having its own test suite devoted to it.

Test doubles were used, to ensure each test suite was testing the functionality and behaviour specific to each particular class. 

The types of test doubles used were: 

* Mocks
* Spies
* Stubs
